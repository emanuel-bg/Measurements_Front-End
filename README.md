# TODO

- [ ] Fix vulnerabilities displayed when `npm install`
  - 9 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high) DONE
- [ ] Add .env.example with required env variables without real value
- [ ] Fix eslint warnings ( displayed on npm start)
- [ ] Remove unncessary files like a.png and logo.svg and any non used file.
- [ ] Format code, there are several files without proper formatting. It will help with readability of the code.
- [ ] Consider renaming API to api, it is easier to type.
- [ ] Change any Spanish comments to English comments
- [ ] Remove debugger and console.log, it should be used only on development.
  - In production we should use external service like Sentry for error logs.
